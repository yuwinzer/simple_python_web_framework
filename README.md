# my simple python framework is in development

Before run the framework install all packages:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Starting simple framework
run command 
```gunicorn app:app --bind 127.0.0.1:8010``` 
"--bind" helps to start localhost with port 8010, 
you can change port, if it already is used
